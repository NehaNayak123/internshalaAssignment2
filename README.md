Hello Sir/Ma'am,
I am neha nayak,
I dont have any tech degree but i want to become a web developer thats why i started my study from youtube also.
In this Assigment i feel that multiple things is new for me, i learn how to make utility class, how to do alignment ,
choose color, transparancy, linear gradient, hover effect, collecting data from here and there and this was tough for me.
Responsive was too tough but finally i did.
I have so many things to share with you but i know you dont have that much time.
Thank You for evaluating my Website!!!
